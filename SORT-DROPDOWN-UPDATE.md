## 🔍 How It Works

### **Public Page Sorting (Client-Side)**
```javascript
// In browse.js
sortPodcasts() {
    switch (this.currentSort) {
        case 'latest':
            // Sort by latest_episode_date DESC
            break;
        case 'title':
            // Sort alphabetically
            break;
    }
    this.renderPodcasts();
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Sorts the `filteredPodcasts` array in memory
- Re-renders the grid
- Does NOT save to server
- Does NOT affect admin or RSS feed

### **Admin Page Sorting (Server-Side)**
```javascript
// In sort-manager.js
async saveSort(sortBy, order) {
    // Saves to data/sort-preference.json
    // Affects RSS feed output
    // Syncs across all browsers
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Saves preference to server file
- Used by `feed.php` for RSS output
- Affects what external apps see
- Completely independent from public sorting
