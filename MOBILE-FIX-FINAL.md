# Mobile CSS - ACTUAL FIX Applied

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - CSS cascade order issue resolved

---

## What Was Broken

1. **Buttons/badges too small** - Hard to read and tap
2. **No horizontal padding** - Cards went edge-to-edge, no peek
3. **Hover effects on tap** - Play overlay appeared on tap/scroll
4. **Blue selection highlight** - Text got selected/highlighted on tap

---

## Root Cause

**CSS files loading AFTER `browse.css` were overriding mobile fixes.**

The problem was CSS cascade order:
```
browse.css           ← Had mobile fixes
   ↓ (overridden by)
sort-controls.css    ← Unprotected :hover rules
player-modal.css     ← 17+ unprotected :hover rules  
components.css       ← 25+ unprotected :hover rules
```

Plus: `style.css` reduces `html { font-size: 14px }` on mobile, shrinking all rem-based sizes by 12.5%.

---

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ 1. Added Inline CSS to `index.php` (Lines 37-156)
**Nuclear option:** Inline CSS with `!important` overrides ALL external stylesheets.

**Mobile/Tablet (≤768px):**
- Universal `*:hover` reset
- Play overlay: `display: none !important`
- Text selection: `user-select: none !important`
- Blue tap highlight: `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent !important`
- **Badge sizes: 18px font, 44px min-height** (FIXED PX)
- Sort button: 48px min-height

**Phone (≤480px):**
- Root font-size: `16px !important` (prevents rem shrinking)
- Grid padding: `0 32px` (creates peek effect)
- Card scale: `0.88` (shows adjacent cards)
- **Badge sizes: 20px font, 48px min-height** (EXTRA LARGE)

### ✅ 2. Fixed `sort-controls.css`
Wrapped 3 hover rules in `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` so they don't trigger on touch devices.

### ✅ 3. Aggressive Cache-Busting
Added `?v=<?php echo time(); ?>` to ALL 6 stylesheets in `index.php` to force fresh load.

## What Should Happen Now

### On iPad/Tablet (≤768px):
- ✅ Badges are 18px (readable, touch-friendly 44px height)
- ✅ No hover overlay on tap
- ✅ No blue highlight on tap
- ✅ Can't select text
- ✅ Sort button is 48px height (easy to tap)

### On iPhone/Phone (≤480px):
- ✅ Badges are 20px (EXTRA LARGE, 48px height)
- ✅ Cards scaled to 88% with 32px side padding (shows peek)
- ✅ All hover effects disabled
- ✅ All text selection disabled

### On Desktop (>768px):
- ✅ Everything works normally
- ✅ Hover effects enabled
- ✅ No changes

## Testing Instructions

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - iPad: Hold refresh button → "Reload Without Content Blockers"
   - iPhone: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
   - Or just force quit Safari and reopen

2. **Visit:** `http://podcast.supersoul.top`

3. **Test:**
   - Tap podcast cards → No play overlay should appear
   - Tap and hold text → Should NOT select (no blue highlight)
   - Check badge sizes → Should be LARGE and readable
   - Scroll horizontally on phone → Should see peek of next card
   - Tap sort button → Should be easy to tap (48px height)

---

## Files Modified

1. `/index.php` - Added inline mobile CSS (lines 37-156)
2. `/assets/css/sort-controls.css` - Wrapped hover rules in media queries
3. `/MOBILE-CSS-POSTMORTEM.md` - Updated with real root cause

---

## Why This Took So Long

**CSS cascade warfare.** Mobile fixes in `browse.css` were being overridden by hover rules in stylesheets loading AFTER it. The inline CSS with `!important` is the nuclear option that ensures mobile rules have final say, regardless of cascade order.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check viewport width on device:
   ```javascript
   alert(window.innerWidth);
   ```
   Should be ≤768px for tablet, ≤480px for phone

2. Check if media query matched - add this temporarily to top of inline CSS:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     body::before {
       content: "MOBILE CSS ACTIVE";
       position: fixed;
       top: 0;
       left: 0;
       background: red;
       color: white;
       padding: 10px;
       z-index: 99999;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Check computed styles in Safari Inspector:
   - Long press on badge → Inspect Element
   - Check computed font-size (should be 18px or 20px)
   - Check computed min-height (should be 44px or 48px)

## Bottom Line

The fix is in place. Hard refresh your devices and test. The inline CSS with `!important` flags should override everything.
