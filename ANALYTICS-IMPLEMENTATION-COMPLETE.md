## üìä Data Structure

### XML Format
```xml
<analytics version="1.0">
  <day date="2025-10-30">
    <metric 
      type="play" 
      podcast_id="pod123" 
      episode_id="ep_abc" 
      count="17" 
      unique_visitors="15"
      episode_title="Episode Title"
      podcast_title="Podcast Name"
      session_ids="uuid1,uuid2,..."
    />
  </day>
</analytics>
```

### API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "range": "7d",
  "overview": {
    "totalPlays": 1234,
    "totalDownloads": 342,
    "uniqueListeners": 876,
    "playToDownloadRate": 0.28
  },
  "dailySeries": [
    { "date": "2025-10-24", "plays": 120, "downloads": 45 }
  ],
  "topEpisodes": [...],
  "topPodcasts": [...]
}
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Event Tracking (Frontend)
```javascript
// When episode starts playing
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('audio:episodeStarted', {
  detail: { episode, podcast }
}));

// Analytics tracker listens and logs
analyticsTracker.logPlay(episode, podcast);
```

### 2. Deduplication
- **sessionStorage**: Tracks logged events per session
- **localStorage**: Stores session ID (24-hour expiry)
- **Backend**: Additional session ID tracking for unique visitors

### 3. Aggregation
- **Daily Buckets**: Events grouped by date
- **Metric Nodes**: Separate nodes for each podcast/episode/type combination
- **Counters**: Increment counts, track unique session IDs

### 4. Visualization
- **Fetch Data**: API call with time range parameter
- **Filter**: Optional podcast-specific filtering
- **Render**: Chart.js charts, overview cards, tables
