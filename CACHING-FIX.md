# Browser Caching Issue - Fixed

## The Problem

The feed IS sorting correctly on the server, but your browser is showing the old cached version.

## Proof It's Working

Server-Side Test:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=desc"
```

Result shows correct order:
1. Labor Radio (Oct 13, 4:00 PM)
2. WJFF (Oct 13, 2:00 PM)  
3. 3rd & Fairfax (Oct 9, 10:31 PM)

## What I Fixed

1. Removed caching headers - feed now has no-cache headers
2. Added debug comment showing sort parameters and timestamp

## How to See Changes

### Hard Refresh
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
- Windows: Ctrl + Shift + F5

### Or Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Or Use Incognito Window
Open feed URL in private browsing

## Verify

Check the feed now includes:
```xml
<!-- Sorted by: episodes, Order: desc, Generated: timestamp -->
```

The sorting IS working - just need to bypass browser cache!
