# Latest Episode Date Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## Problem
Main page showed "2 days ago" while both modals showed "Yesterday" for the same podcast (WJFF Radio Chatskill).

## Root Cause
**Timezone Mismatch Between Server and Client**

- **Main page (index.php):** Used PHP date calculation in server timezone
- **Modals (JavaScript):** Used client-side calculation in user's browser timezone
- Result: Different relative dates for the same episode

## Solution
**Move ALL date calculations to client-side JavaScript**

### Files Changed

#### 1. `/index.php` (lines 331-334)
**Before:** Complex PHP date calculation with strtotime()  
**After:** Simple HTML with data attribute
```html
<td class="latest-episode-cell" data-date="<?php echo $podcast['latest_episode_date']; ?>">
    <span>Loading...</span>
</td>
```

#### 2. `/assets/js/app.js` (lines 1658-1721)
**Added:** Two new functions

**`formatLatestEpisodeDate(dateString)`**
- Exact same logic as player-modal.js
- Calculates relative dates (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
- Uses user's local timezone
- Returns formatted HTML

**`updateAllLatestEpisodeDates()`**
- Runs on page load (DOMContentLoaded)
- Finds all `.latest-episode-cell` elements
- Updates each with calculated date
- Ensures consistency across entire page

## Why This Works

### Before (BROKEN)
```
Server (PHP) â†’ Calculates in server TZ â†’ Shows "2 days ago"
Browser (JS) â†’ Calculates in user TZ â†’ Shows "Yesterday"
```

### After (FIXED)
```
Server (PHP) â†’ Just outputs raw date â†’ No calculation
Browser (JS) â†’ Calculates in user TZ â†’ Shows "Yesterday"
Browser (JS) â†’ Calculates in user TZ â†’ Shows "Yesterday"
```

All calculations now happen in the same environment (user's browser) with the same timezone.

## Benefits

âœ… **Consistent Display:** All three locations (main page, player modal, podcast info modal) now show identical dates  
âœ… **Correct Timezone:** Uses user's local time, not server time  
âœ… **Shared Logic:** Same `formatDate()` calculation everywhere  
âœ… **No Server Issues:** No PHP timezone configuration needed  
âœ… **Future-Proof:** Works regardless of server location or user location  

## Testing

Verified with WJFF Radio Chatskill (latest episode: Oct 15, 2025):
- âœ… Main page: "Yesterday"
- âœ… Player modal: "Yesterday"  
- âœ… Podcast info modal: "Yesterday"

All three now match! ðŸŽ‰

## Technical Details

**Date Format in Database:** `2025-10-15 14:00:00` (MySQL datetime)  
**JavaScript Parsing:** `new Date("2025-10-15 14:00:00")` interprets as local time  
**Calculation Method:** Midnight normalization for accurate day comparison

```javascript
const dateOnly = new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate());
const nowOnly = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
const diffDays = Math.round((nowOnly - dateOnly) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Client-side is better for user-facing dates** - always use user's timezone
2. **PHP and JavaScript handle timezones differently** - can't just copy logic
3. **Consistency requires shared code** - same calculation = same result
4. **Test with real data** - timezone bugs only show with actual dates
