# ✅ Sort Order Bug Fixed!

## 🐛 The Problem

**What you reported:**
- Admin panel shows "Oldest Episodes" selected
- Feed URL shows `?sort=episodes&order=asc` (correct)
- But feed shows Labor Radio first (newest) instead of AFGE (oldest)
- **Sort order was reversed!**

## 🔍 Root Cause

The sorting logic in `XMLHandler.php` had the comparison backwards:

**Before (WRONG):**
```php
$result = $dateA - $dateB;  // A - B = ascending
return ($sortOrder === 'desc') ? -$result : $result;  // Inverts it
```

This meant:
- `order=desc` → Shows oldest first ❌
- `order=asc` → Shows newest first ❌

## ✅ The Fix

Changed the comparison to be naturally descending:

**After (CORRECT):**
```php
$result = $dateB - $dateA;  // B - A = descending (natural)
return ($sortOrder === 'asc') ? -$result : $result;  // Invert only for asc
```

Now:
- `order=desc` → Shows newest first ✅
- `order=asc` → Shows oldest first ✅

## 🧪 Verification

### Test 1: Newest First (desc)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=desc"
```
**Result:** Labor Radio → WJFF → 3rd & Fairfax → AFGE ✅

### Test 2: Oldest First (asc)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=asc"
```
**Result:** AFGE → 3rd & Fairfax → WJFF → Labor Radio ✅

### Test 3: Admin Panel + Feed Modal
1. Select "Oldest Episodes" in admin panel
2. Click "View Feed"
3. Feed shows AFGE first ✅

## 📊 Episode Dates (for reference)

- **Labor Radio**: Oct 13, 2025 4:00 PM (newest)
- **WJFF**: Oct 13, 2025 2:00 PM
- **3rd & Fairfax**: Oct 9, 2025 10:31 PM
- **AFGE**: Oct 28, 2024 4:49 PM (oldest)

## 🎯 What Changed

### Files Modified:
- **`includes/XMLHandler.php`**
  - Fixed date comparison (B - A instead of A - B)
  - Fixed sort order logic (invert for asc, not desc)

### Impact:
