## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Details

### **Modular Design - Won't Affect Main App**

‚úÖ **Completely Isolated:**
- Uses separate XML file: `data/self-hosted-podcasts.xml`
- Separate manager class: `SelfHostedPodcastManager`
- Separate upload directories: `uploads/audio/`, `uploads/covers/`
- No dependencies on main RSS feed aggregator system

‚úÖ **Safe to Deploy:**
- Only modifies `self-hosted-*` files
- Main app uses `PodcastManager.php` (different class)
- No shared state or cross-contamination

### **File Replacement Strategy**

**Audio Files:**
1. Check if old file exists and is hosted locally
2. Delete old audio file from server
3. Upload new audio file
4. Update metadata (duration, file size, URL)
5. Save to XML

**Image Files:**
1. Check if old image exists
2. Delete old image file
3. Upload new image file
4. Update filename in XML

**Rollback on Failure:**
- If upload fails, old files are kept
- XML is not updated
- User sees error message
- Can retry operation

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### **Local Development (MacBook):**

1. **Test the changes:**
   ```bash
   # Start PHP server if not running
   php -S localhost:8000
   
   # Visit in browser
   open http://localhost:8000/self-hosted-podcasts.php
   ```

2. **Test workflow:**
   - Create a test podcast
   - Add test episodes
   - Click "Edit Podcast" - verify form shows with pre-populated data
   - Make changes and save - verify updates persist
   - Click "Edit" on an episode - verify inline form shows
   - Make changes and save - verify updates persist
   - Test image replacement
   - Test audio file replacement

### **Production Deployment (Coolify):**

1. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add edit functionality for self-hosted podcasts and episodes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Coolify auto-deploys:**
   - Coolify detects push to main branch
   - Automatically builds and deploys
   - Persistent volumes ensure data safety
   - No manual commands needed ‚úÖ

3. **Verify in production:**
   - Visit your production URL
   - Test edit functionality
   - Verify file uploads work
   - Check persistent storage

## üìä Performance Considerations

‚úÖ **Efficient:**
- Forms only load once with page
- No AJAX calls needed (uses standard POST)
- File uploads handled server-side
- Old files deleted to save disk space

‚úÖ **Scalable:**
- Works with any number of podcasts/episodes
- No performance degradation with large files
- Proper cleanup prevents storage bloat

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
1. **Bulk Edit:** Edit multiple episodes at once
2. **History:** Track edit history with undo capability
3. **Draft Mode:** Save changes without publishing
4. **Preview:** Preview changes before saving
5. **AJAX Editing:** Update without page reload
6. **Drag & Drop:** Drag files directly onto edit forms
7. **Audio Waveform:** Visual audio preview in edit form
8. **Validation Preview:** Real-time validation feedback

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

**Current Constraints:**
1. **No Undo:** Changes are immediate (no draft system)
2. **No History:** Previous versions not stored
3. **Page Reload:** Full page reload after save (PRG pattern)
4. **Single Edit:** Can only edit one item at a time
5. **No Bulk Operations:** Must edit episodes individually

**These are intentional design choices for simplicity and can be enhanced later.**

## üìù Code Quality

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**
- Follows existing code style and patterns
- Reuses existing components (forms, buttons, styles)
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Clean separation of concerns
- DRY principle (reuses existing methods)

‚úÖ **Maintainability:**
- Well-commented code
