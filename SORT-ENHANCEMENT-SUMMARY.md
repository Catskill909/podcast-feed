# Sort Enhancement - Episode Date Sorting

## ✅ What Was Changed

You're absolutely right! The sorting now uses **actual podcast episode dates** from the RSS feeds, not just the database creation dates. This makes much more sense for a podcast app where you want to show which podcasts have the newest episodes.

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Smart Date Sorting**
- **Before**: Sorted by when you added the podcast to your database
- **After**: Sorts by the latest episode date from each podcast's RSS feed
- **Fallback**: If no episode date is available, falls back to creation date

### 2. **Automatic Feed Parsing**
When importing a podcast via RSS, the system now automatically extracts:
- ✅ Latest episode publication date
- ✅ Total episode count
- ✅ Stores this data in the XML database

### 3. **Manual Refresh Button**
- New **🔄 Refresh** button in the Actions column
- Click it to fetch the latest episode data from any podcast feed
- Updates the sort order automatically
- Shows success message with latest episode date

### 4. **Updated Sort Labels**
- "Newest First" → "Newest Episodes"
- "Oldest First" → "Oldest Episodes"
- Section renamed: "Sort by Date" → "Sort by Episode Date"

## 📊 Data Structure

### XML Schema (per podcast):
```xml
<podcast id="pod_123">
    <title>My Podcast</title>
    <feed_url>https://example.com/feed.xml</feed_url>
    <description>...</description>
    <cover_image>pod_123.jpg</cover_image>
    <created_date>2025-01-13T14:00:00+00:00</created_date>
    <updated_date>2025-01-13T14:00:00+00:00</updated_date>
    <status>active</status>
    <latest_episode_date>2025-01-10 12:30:00</latest_episode_date>
    <episode_count>156</episode_count>
</podcast>
```

### HTML Row Attributes:
```html
<tr data-podcast-id="pod_123"
    data-description="..."
    data-latest-episode="2025-01-10 12:30:00"
    data-episode-count="156">
```

1. Import your favorite podcasts
2. Click "Refresh All" periodically to update episode dates
3. Sort by "Newest Episodes" to see what's fresh
4. Your RSS feed reflects this order for podcast apps
