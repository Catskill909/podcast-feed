## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Edit Button Error** ✅
**Problem:** Edit button showed "Error loading podcast data" in production

**Cause:** Changed Feed URL from link to button, broke the selector

**Fix:**
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
const feedUrl = row.querySelector('td:nth-child(3) a').textContent.trim();

// NEW (fixed):
const feedButton = row.querySelector('td:nth-child(3) button');
const onclickAttr = feedButton.getAttribute('onclick');
const feedUrl = onclickAttr.match(/showPodcastFeedModal\('([^']+)'/)[1];
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed

---

### 2. **Sort Order Reversed** ✅
**Problem:** "Newest Episodes" showed oldest first, "Oldest Episodes" showed newest first

**Cause:** Comparison logic was backwards in `XMLHandler.php`

**Fix:**
```php
// OLD (wrong):
$result = $dateA - $dateB;  // Ascending
return ($sortOrder === 'desc') ? -$result : $result;  // Double-reversed!

// NEW (correct):
$result = $dateB - $dateA;  // Descending (natural)
return ($sortOrder === 'asc') ? -$result : $result;  // Invert only for asc
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed

---

### 3. **Latest Episode = "Unknown" in Production** ✅
**Problem:** All podcasts showed "Unknown" for latest episode in production

**Cause:** Production database (`podcasts.xml`) didn't have episode dates populated

**Why it worked locally:** We manually ran the scan locally, data persisted

**Fix:**
1. Created migration script: `migrate-episode-dates.php`
2. Ran in production: `php /app/cron/auto-scan-feeds.php`
3. Populated all episode dates
4. Set up Coolify cron for ongoing updates

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and automated

---
