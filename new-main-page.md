# New Main Page - Public Podcast Browser

## Overview
Transform the current admin interface into a beautiful public-facing podcast browser with a separate admin section protected by password.

## Current State
- `index.php` is currently the admin interface with full CRUD operations
- Password protection is active on the main page
- Player modal exists and works well - will be reused

## Proposed Architecture

- Reuse existing:
  - `style.css` (base styles)
  - `player-modal.css` (modal)
  - `components.css` (shared components)

### JavaScript Files
- Create `assets/js/browse.js` for public page logic
- Reuse existing:
