# ✅ UI Cleanup Complete!

## 🎨 Changes Made

### 1. Feed URL → Button ✅

**Before:**
- Long URL text taking up horizontal space
- URLs truncated with "..."
- Hard to read, cluttered

**After:**
- Clean button: `📡 View Feed`
- Compact, consistent width
- Full URL shown in tooltip on hover
- Opens same feed modal as before

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Much more horizontal space
- ✅ Table fits on single line
- ✅ Cleaner, more professional look
- ✅ Consistent with other action buttons

---

### 2. Episode Date Colors Fixed ✅

**Before:**
- All dates showing green (confusing)
- Old dates like "Oct 28, 2024" were green

**After:**
- **Green (bold)**: "Today" (< 24 hours)
- **Green**: "Yesterday" (24-48 hours)
- **Green**: "X days ago" (< 7 days)
- **Gray**: Older dates (> 7 days) - "Oct 28, 2024"
- **Gray italic**: "Unknown" (no data)

**Logic:**
```php
if ($diff < 86400) {
    // Today - green, bold
} elseif ($diff < 172800) {
    // Yesterday - green
} elseif ($diff < 604800) {
    // X days ago - green
} else {
    // Older than 7 days - gray, no green
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Green = recent activity (easy to spot)
- ✅ Gray = old episodes (less emphasis)
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Makes sense at a glance
