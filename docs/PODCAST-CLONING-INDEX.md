## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] Requirements gathering
- [x] Architecture design
- [x] Existing systems audit
- [x] Integration strategy
- [x] Documentation complete

### Phase 2: Development (NEXT)

**Before You Start:**
1. Read [`podcast-feed-cloning-summary.md`](./podcast-feed-cloning-summary.md) (full overview)
2. Read [`IMPORT-FUNCTIONS-AUDIT.md`](./IMPORT-FUNCTIONS-AUDIT.md) (understand existing code)
3. Reference [`podcast-feed-cloning.md`](./podcast-feed-cloning.md) (detailed specs)

**During Development:**
- Use Technical Spec as your primary reference
- Check Audit doc when integrating with existing code
- Refer to Summary for high-level decisions

## 📋 Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Confirmed Requirements

1. **Leverage Existing AJAX Upload System**
   - Location: `assets/js/audio-uploader.js` + `api/upload-audio-chunk.php`
   - Already bypasses PHP limits (500MB files)
   - Proven in production

2. **Beautiful Live Progress Modal**
   - Phase-based display (Creating → Cloning)
   - Real-time updates via AJAX (every 2 seconds)
   - Nested progress bars
   - Live statistics

3. **Complete Delete Cleanup**
   - Remove ALL assets (audio, images, XML, temp files)
   - Enhancement needed in `SelfHostedPodcastManager->deletePodcast()`

### ✅ Integration Strategy

**Cloning Flow:**
```
External Feed → Validate (REUSE) → Parse (REUSE) → Clone (NEW) → My Podcasts
                                                                        ↓
                                                    (Optional) Import to Main Directory (REUSE)
```

**What to Reuse:**
- ✅ Validation: `api/validate-rss-import.php`
- ✅ Parsing: `includes/RssFeedParser.php`
- ✅ Audio Upload: `includes/AudioUploader.php`
- ✅ Image Upload: `includes/ImageUploader.php`
- ✅ Podcast Creation: `SelfHostedPodcastManager->createPodcast()`
- ✅ Import to Directory: `PodcastManager->createPodcast()`

**What to Build:**
- ❌ `includes/PodcastFeedCloner.php` (orchestrator)
- ❌ `includes/PodcastAudioDownloader.php` (download bridge)
- ❌ `api/clone-feed.php` (progress endpoint)
- ❌ `assets/js/feed-cloner.js` (frontend UI)

## 📊 Project Metrics

**Estimated Development:**
- **Time:** 3 weeks
- **Code:** ~2,500 lines
- **Files:** 4 new, 2 enhanced
- **Risk:** Medium (downloads, storage, timeouts)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Complete podcast migration tool

**Example Clone:**
- **Input:** RSS feed URL
- **Output:** 150 episodes, 2.5GB, all local
- **Time:** ~15-30 minutes (depends on internet speed)

## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Critical Points:

1. **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**
   - Reuse existing validation, parsing, and upload systems
   - Follow same patterns as RSS import and My Podcasts

2. **Bypass PHP Limits**
   - Use existing `AudioUploader` class (already handles 500MB files)
   - Don't try to upload directly - use the AJAX system

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update progress file every episode
   - Frontend polls every 2 seconds
   - Show detailed status (phase, episode, action)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Log failed episodes but continue
   - Allow resume capability
   - Clean up temp files

5. **Delete Cleanup**
   - Must remove ALL assets
   - Check for orphaned files
   - Test with large clones (150+ episodes)

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If you're stuck:

1. **Check the Technical Spec** - Most answers are there
2. **Review the Audit** - Understand existing code first
3. **Look at existing features** - RSS import and My Podcasts are similar
4. **Test incrementally** - Start with small feeds (5 episodes)

### Common Questions:

**Q: How do I bypass PHP upload limits?**  
A: Use existing `AudioUploader` class - it's already built! See Audit doc.

**Q: How do I validate feeds?**  
A: Use existing `api/validate-rss-import.php` - same as RSS import.

**Q: How do I show progress?**  
A: Update JSON file, frontend polls via AJAX. See Technical Spec.

**Q: How do I import to main directory?**  
A: Use existing `PodcastManager->createPodcast()` - same as RSS import. See Audit doc.
