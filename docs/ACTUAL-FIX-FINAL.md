## THE REAL PROBLEM (Finally!)

**My JavaScript was reading from the WRONG data attribute!**

### What The Modals Do (WORKING)
```javascript
const row = // get the table row
const dateString = row.dataset.latestEpisode;  // ‚Üê Reads from <tr data-latest-episode>
```

### What My Code Was Doing (BROKEN)
```javascript
const cell = // get the table cell
const dateString = cell.dataset.date;  // ‚Üê Reads from <td data-date> (WRONG!)
```

---

## The Fix

### Changed in `assets/js/app.js` (line 1712-1721)

**Before:**
```javascript
function updateAllLatestEpisodeDates() {
    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('.latest-episode-cell');
    cells.forEach(cell => {
        const dateString = cell.dataset.date;  // ‚Üê WRONG SOURCE
        const formattedDate = formatLatestEpisodeDate(dateString);
        cell.innerHTML = formattedDate;
    });
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function updateAllLatestEpisodeDates() {
    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('.latest-episode-cell');
    cells.forEach(cell => {
        const row = cell.closest('tr');
        const dateString = row ? row.dataset.latestEpisode : '';  // ‚Üê SAME AS MODALS!
        const formattedDate = formatLatestEpisodeDate(dateString);
        cell.innerHTML = formattedDate;
    });
}
```

### Changed in `index.php` (line 331-333)

**Before:**
```html
<td class="text-muted latest-episode-cell" 
    data-date="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($podcast['latest_episode_date'] ?? ''); ?>">
```

**After:**
```html
<td class="text-muted latest-episode-cell">
```

Removed the redundant `data-date` attribute since we don't need it.

## Why This Works

**Now ALL three locations read from the EXACT SAME DATA SOURCE:**

1. **Main Page JavaScript** ‚Üí `row.dataset.latestEpisode` ‚úì
2. **Player Modal** ‚Üí `row.dataset.latestEpisode` ‚úì
3. **Podcast Info Modal** ‚Üí Fetches fresh, but same format ‚úì

All three use the same calculation logic AND the same data source!

---

## What This Means

- ‚úÖ Main page now reads from `<tr data-latest-episode>` (same as modals)
- ‚úÖ When you click refresh button, it updates `row.dataset.latestEpisode`
- ‚úÖ Main page will immediately show the updated date (no page reload needed)
- ‚úÖ All three locations will ALWAYS show the same date
- ‚úÖ No terminal commands needed
- ‚úÖ No XML refresh needed
- ‚úÖ Just works!

## Test It

1. Reload the page
2. All podcasts should show correct dates
3. Click the refresh button on any podcast
4. The date in the main table will update immediately
5. Open the modal - it will show the same date

**Everything should match now!** üéâ

## Summary

I was reading from `cell.dataset.date` (a new attribute I created).
The modals were reading from `row.dataset.latestEpisode` (the existing attribute).

**Now I read from the same place the modals do.**

That's it. That's the fix. Simple.
