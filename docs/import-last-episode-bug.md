# Latest Episode Date Not Showing on Import - Analysis and Fix Plan

## Issue Description
When importing a new RSS feed, the "Latest Episode" column shows as "Unknown" even though:
1. The feed contains valid episode dates
2. The info modal correctly displays the latest episode date
3. The date is being parsed correctly in the `RssFeedParser` class

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the code, here's what's happening:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - The `RssFeedParser` correctly extracts and parses the latest episode date in `getLatestEpisodeDate()` and `getLatestEpisodeDateAtom()` methods
   - The date is properly formatted as 'Y-m-d H:i:s' and returned in the parsed data
   - The issue likely occurs when this data is saved to the database or when it's being displayed

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The database column for storing the latest episode date might be missing or incorrectly named
   - The date might not be properly saved during the import process
   - There might be a mismatch between the date format in the database and what's being saved
   - The frontend might be expecting a different date format than what's being provided

3. **Key Findings**:
   - The `RssFeedParser` returns the date in 'Y-m-d H:i:s' format
   - The date is properly extracted from both RSS and Atom feeds
   - The issue is not with the parsing logic but likely with how the data is handled after parsing

## Investigation Plan

1. **Check Database Schema**
   - Verify the structure of the podcasts table
   - Confirm the existence and data type of the latest_episode_date column

2. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Follow the data from the import endpoint through to database storage
   - Check if the date is being modified or lost during this process

3. **Inspect Frontend Code**
   - Examine how the latest episode date is displayed in the UI
   - Check if there's any client-side formatting or validation that might be causing the issue

4. **Debug Import Process**
   - Add logging to track the date value at different stages
   - Verify the data being sent to the client during import

## Proposed Solution

1. **Database Check**
   - Ensure the `latest_episode_date` column exists in the podcasts table
   - Verify the column type is DATETIME or TIMESTAMP

2. **Import Process**
   - Add validation to ensure the date is properly formatted before saving
   - Add error handling for date parsing failures

3. **Frontend Display**
   - Ensure the frontend can handle the date format being provided
   - Add fallback display for invalid or missing dates

4. **Testing**
   - Test with multiple feed types (RSS and Atom)
   - Verify the behavior with feeds that have different date formats

## Next Steps
1. Implement database validation and fixes if needed
2. Add comprehensive logging to track the date value through the import process
3. Test the fix with various feed types and date formats
4. Update documentation to include any changes to the import process
