**Solutions:**
- Verify audio URL is publicly accessible (test in browser)

- Check that file is actually an MP3 (not M4A or other format)
- Verify CORS headers if hosting on different domain

### Cover Image Not Showing

**Problem:** Podcast image doesn't appear

**Solutions:**
- Check image file size (must be under 2MB)
