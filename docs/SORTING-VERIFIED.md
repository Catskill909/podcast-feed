# ✅ Sorting is Working Correctly!

## The Confusion

You're seeing the feed always show the same order because **it's working correctly** - it's showing newest episodes first (the default).

## Proof It's Working

### Test 1: Default (Newest Episodes First)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php"
```
**Order:**
1. Labor Radio (Oct 13, 4:00 PM) ← Newest episode
2. WJFF (Oct 13, 2:00 PM)
3. 3rd & Fairfax (Oct 9, 10:31 PM)
4. AFGE (Oct 28, 2024) ← Oldest episode

✅ **Correct!**

### Test 2: Alphabetical (A-Z)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=title&order=asc"
```
**Order:**
1. 3rd & Fairfax (starts with "3")
2. AFGE (starts with "A")
3. Labor Radio (starts with "L")
4. WJFF (starts with "W")

✅ **Correct!**

### Test 3: Oldest Episodes First
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=asc"
```
**Order:**
1. AFGE (Oct 28, 2024) ← Oldest
2. 3rd & Fairfax (Oct 9, 2025)
3. WJFF (Oct 13, 2:00 PM)
4. Labor Radio (Oct 13, 4:00 PM) ← Newest

✅ **Correct!**

## Why It Looks the Same

When you view `http://localhost:8000/feed.php` (no parameters), it defaults to:
```php
$sortBy = 'episodes';  // Default
$sortOrder = 'desc';   // Newest first
```

This is the **correct default** for a podcast app - you want newest episodes first!

## Episode Dates (From Scanner)

Your automated scanner updated these dates:
- **Labor Radio**: Oct 13, 2025 16:00:00 (4:00 PM)
- **WJFF**: Oct 13, 2025 14:00:00 (2:00 PM)
- **3rd & Fairfax**: Oct 9, 2025 22:31:00 (10:31 PM)
- **AFGE**: Oct 28, 2024 16:49:11 (4:49 PM)

So Labor Radio SHOULD be first - it has the newest episode!

## To See Different Sorts

### In Browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=title&order=asc
http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=asc
http://localhost:8000/feed.php?sort=date&order=desc
```

### In Admin Panel:
The sort dropdown in the admin panel only affects the visual display (JavaScript), not the feed URL.

## The System is Working!

1. ✅ Cron updates episode dates every 30 minutes
2. ✅ Feed sorts by latest episode dates
3. ✅ Labor Radio appears first (has newest episode)
4. ✅ Different sort parameters work correctly
5. ✅ Default is newest episodes first (perfect for podcast apps!)

## What You're Seeing is Correct

The feed showing Labor Radio first IS the correct behavior because:
- It has the newest episode (Oct 13, 4 PM)
- Default sort is newest episodes first
- This is what podcast apps want to see

If you want a different default, we can change it in feed.php, but "newest episodes first" is the right default for production!
