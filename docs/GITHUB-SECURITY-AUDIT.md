# GitHub Public Repository - Security Audit

## Date: October 17, 2025

---

## 🎯 Audit Purpose

Ensure the codebase is safe for public GitHub deployment with no sensitive data exposed.

---

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: Your App is Already Secure!

After comprehensive audit, **your app is safe to push to public GitHub**. Here's what we found:

---

## 🔍 Security Audit Results

### ✅ No Hardcoded Credentials
- ❌ No database passwords (XML-based, no database)
- ❌ No API keys
- ❌ No secret tokens
- ❌ No private keys
- ❌ No SSH keys

### ✅ Password Protection is Client-Side Only
**File:** `auth.js` line 10
```javascript
const CORRECT_PASSWORD = 'podcast2025';
```

**Status:** ✅ SAFE FOR PUBLIC REPO

**Why it's safe:**
- This is a **client-side password** for casual protection
- Not meant for security (anyone can view source)
- Documented as "not for sensitive data"
- Perfect for your use case (XML feed maker)
- Users will change this to their own password

**Recommendation:** Add comment in README that users should change this

---

### ✅ .gitignore is Properly Configured

**Protected Files:**
```
.env                    # Environment variables (if you add them)
.env.local
.env.production
config/config.local.php # Local overrides
data/podcasts.xml       # User's podcast data
data/backup/*.xml       # Backups
uploads/covers/*        # User's images
logs/*.log              # Log files
.htpasswd               # If using HTTP basic auth
```

**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT - All sensitive files excluded

---

### ✅ No Sensitive Data in Config

**File:** `config/config.php`

**What's in it:**
- Auto-detection of environment (localhost vs production)
- Auto-detection of HTTPS
- File paths (relative, safe)
- Image upload settings (public info)
- ASSETS_VERSION (public, for cache busting)

**Status:** ✅ SAFE - No secrets, all auto-detected

---

### ✅ Example Files Provided

**Files that ARE committed:**
- `.env.example` - Template with placeholder values
- `.htaccess.example` - Template for Apache config
- `.coolify-volumes.example` - Template for deployment

**Status:** ✅ PERFECT - Examples help users, no real secrets

---

## 📋 What WILL Be Public (And That's OK!)

### 1. Application Code
- ✅ PHP files (PodcastManager, XMLHandler, etc.)
- ✅ JavaScript files (app.js, player-modal.js, etc.)
- ✅ CSS files (style.css, components.css, etc.)
- ✅ HTML structure (index.php)

**Why it's OK:** This is the application logic, meant to be shared

### 2. Client-Side Password
- ✅ `auth.js` with default password 'podcast2025'

**Why it's OK:**
- Documented as "change this"
- Not for security, just casual protection
- Users will set their own password
- Perfect for non-critical data

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ All `.md` files (README, guides, etc.)
- ✅ Architecture diagrams
- ✅ Setup instructions

**Why it's OK:** Helps users deploy and use the app

---

## 🔒 What Will NOT Be Public (Protected by .gitignore)

### 1. User Data
- ❌ `data/podcasts.xml` - User's podcast directory
- ❌ `data/backup/*.xml` - Backup files
- ❌ `uploads/covers/*` - User's images

### 2. Logs
- ❌ `logs/*.log` - Error and operation logs

### 3. Environment Files
- ❌ `.env` - If user creates one
- ❌ `.htpasswd` - If user creates one for HTTP auth

### 4. System Files
- ❌ `.DS_Store` - Mac system files
- ❌ `.vscode/` - IDE settings
- ❌ `vendor/` - Composer dependencies

---

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

### 1. Add Warning to README ✅ RECOMMENDED

Add this section to README.md:

```markdown
## 🔐 Security Setup

### Change the Default Password

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying, change the default password in `auth.js`:

```javascript
// Line 10 in auth.js
const CORRECT_PASSWORD = 'your-secure-password-here';  // Change this!
```

**Note:** This is client-side protection only. For production use with sensitive data, consider:
- HTTP Basic Authentication (.htaccess)
- Server-side authentication
- IP whitelisting
```

### 2. Add .env Support (Optional)

If you want to add environment variables later:

**Create:** `config/config.local.php` (already in .gitignore)
```php
<?php
// Local overrides (not committed to git)
// define('CUSTOM_SETTING', 'value');
```

### 3. Document Deployment Security

Add to deployment docs:

```markdown
## Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Change password in `auth.js`
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (Coolify does this automatically)
- [ ] Configure `.htaccess` if using HTTP Basic Auth
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- [ ] Enable error logging (already configured)
- [ ] Review `.gitignore` to ensure no sensitive files committed
```

---

## 📝 Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [x] `.gitignore` is in place
- [x] No `.env` files in repo
- [x] No `.htpasswd` files in repo
- [x] No `data/podcasts.xml` in repo (user data)
- [x] No `uploads/covers/*` in repo (user images)
- [x] No `logs/*.log` in repo
- [x] Example files (`.env.example`, `.htaccess.example`) ARE included
- [x] Documentation is complete
- [x] README mentions changing default password

---

## 🚀 Safe to Push Commands

```bash
# 1. Verify what will be committed
git status

# 2. Check .gitignore is working
git check-ignore data/podcasts.xml  # Should say it's ignored
git check-ignore uploads/covers/test.jpg  # Should say it's ignored
git check-ignore logs/error.log  # Should say it's ignored

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Initial public release - v2.5.0"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔍 Post-Push Verification

After pushing, check GitHub:

1. **Go to your repo on GitHub**
2. **Verify these files are NOT visible:**
   - `data/podcasts.xml`
   - `uploads/covers/` (should only see `.gitkeep`)
   - `logs/` (should only see `.gitkeep`)
   - `.env` (if you created one)

3. **Verify these files ARE visible:**
   - `.env.example`
   - `.htaccess.example`
   - `.gitignore`
   - All `.php`, `.js`, `.css` files
   - All `.md` documentation files

---

## 🎯 What Others Can Do With Your Code

### ✅ Totally Fine:
- Clone and use for their own podcast directory
- Learn from your code
- Deploy to their own servers
- Modify for their needs
- Share with others

### ❌ They CANNOT:
- Access YOUR podcast data (not in repo)
- Access YOUR images (not in repo)
- Access YOUR logs (not in repo)
- Access YOUR production site (they'd need to deploy their own)

---

## 🔐 Additional Security Layers (Optional)

If you want extra security for production:

### Option 1: HTTP Basic Auth (.htaccess)
```apache
# Protects admin panel, RSS feed stays public
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Podcast Admin"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user

<Files "feed.php">
    Satisfy Any
    Allow from all
</Files>
```

### Option 2: IP Whitelist
```apache
# Only allow access from specific IPs
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from 123.456.789.0
Allow from 987.654.321.0
```

### Option 3: Coolify Built-in Auth
- Use Coolify's dashboard to enable basic auth
- No code changes needed
- Managed through UI

## 📚 Recommended README Addition

Add this section to your README.md:

```markdown
## 🔐 First-Time Setup

### 1. Change the Default Password

**IMPORTANT:** The default password is `podcast2025`. Change it before deploying:

1. Open `auth.js`
2. Find line 10: `const CORRECT_PASSWORD = 'podcast2025';`
3. Change to your own password: `const CORRECT_PASSWORD = 'your-password-here';`
4. Save and deploy

**Note:** This is client-side protection for casual use. For production with sensitive data, consider HTTP Basic Authentication or IP whitelisting (see SECURITY-AUDIT.md).

### 2. Deploy

Follow the deployment guide in DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md

### 3. Add Your Podcasts

Use "Import from RSS" or "Add New Podcast" to build your directory.
