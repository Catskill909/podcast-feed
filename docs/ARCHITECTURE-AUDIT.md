# Architecture Audit: Feed Aggregator Philosophy

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Verify app aligns with "feed aggregator" philosophy  
**Status:** ✅ Early Beta - Mostly Aligned

---

## 🎯 Philosophy Check

### **What The App Should Be:**
A **feed aggregator** that creates a meta-feed (RSS of RSS feeds) for external consumption.

### **Key Principles:**
1. Source RSS feeds are the source of truth
2. Database is a cache for performance
3. App points to source feeds, doesn't host content
4. Episode data comes from source feeds, not stored permanently

---

## ✅ What's Working Correctly

### **1. Feed Output (feed.php)** ✅ PERFECT
```php
// Line 496: Outputs SOURCE feed URL, not hosted content
$item->appendChild($rss->createElement('link', $podcast['feed_url']));
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Points to source RSS feed URL
- ✅ Doesn't try to host episodes
- ✅ Flutter app will fetch from source feeds
- ✅ Acts as directory/aggregator

**Verdict:** 🟢 **Perfectly aligned with philosophy**

---

### **2. Database Storage** ✅ MOSTLY CORRECT

**What's Stored:**
```xml
<podcast>
    <title>Podcast Name</title>                    <!-- ✅ Metadata -->
    <feed_url>https://source.com/feed.xml</feed_url> <!-- ✅ Pointer to source -->
    <description>...</description>                  <!-- ✅ Metadata -->
    <cover_image>local_file.jpg</cover_image>      <!-- ✅ Cached for performance -->
    <latest_episode_date>2025-10-15</latest_episode_date> <!-- ⚠️ Cached -->
    <episode_count>25</episode_count>              <!-- ⚠️ Cached -->
    <created_date>...</created_date>                <!-- ✅ App metadata -->
    <status>active</status>                         <!-- ✅ App metadata -->
</podcast>
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Stores metadata (title, description, URL)
- ✅ Stores pointer to source feed
- ✅ Caches cover image (performance)
- ⚠️ Caches episode data (updated by cron)
- ✅ Stores app-specific data (status, created date)

**Verdict:** 🟢 **Aligned - episode data is cache, not source of truth**

---

### **3. Cron Job (auto-scan-feeds.php)** ✅ PERFECT

**What It Does:**
```php
// Fetches from SOURCE feeds every 30 minutes
$parser = new RssFeedParser();
$result = $parser->fetchFeedMetadata($podcast['feed_url']);

// Updates CACHE in database
$podcastManager->updatePodcastMetadata($podcastId, [
    'latest_episode_date' => $result['latest_episode_date'],
    'episode_count' => $result['episode_count']
]);
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Fetches from source feeds
- ✅ Updates cache regularly
- ✅ Doesn't try to be source of truth
- ✅ Keeps data fresh without blocking page loads

**Verdict:** 🟢 **Perfectly aligned with philosophy**

---

### **4. RSS Import** ✅ CORRECT (After Today's Fix)

**What It Does:**
```php
// Saves metadata only
$podcastData = [
    'title' => $data['title'],
    'feed_url' => $data['feed_url'],
    'description' => $data['description'],
    'cover_image' => $coverImage,
    // NO episode data stored during import
];
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Saves metadata (title, URL, description)
- ✅ Downloads and caches cover image
- ✅ Does NOT store episode data
- ✅ Lets cron job fetch episode data later

**Verdict:** 🟢 **Perfectly aligned after today's fix**

---

### **5. Display Logic** ✅ CORRECT

**Table Display:**
```php
// Reads from CACHE (database)
$displayDate = $podcast['latest_episode_date'];
```

**Modal Display:**
```php
// Fetches LIVE from source feed
$parser = new RssFeedParser();
$feedData = $parser->fetchAndParse($podcast['feed_url']);
$latest_episode = $feedData['data']['latest_episode_date'];
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Table reads from cache (fast)
- ✅ Modal fetches live (accurate)
- ✅ Two-tier approach balances performance and accuracy
- ✅ User can refresh to update cache

**Verdict:** 🟢 **Perfectly aligned with philosophy**

---

## ⚠️ Minor Concerns (Not Breaking, But Worth Noting)

### **1. Cover Image Storage** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE

**Current Behavior:**
- Downloads cover images from source feeds
- Stores locally in `uploads/covers/`
- Serves from local storage

**Philosophy Check:**
- ⚠️ Technically hosting content (images)
- ✅ But necessary for performance
- ✅ Images are static/rarely change
- ✅ Prevents hotlinking issues

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **Keep as-is** - This is acceptable for performance. Images are metadata, not dynamic content.

---

### **2. Health Monitoring Fields** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE

**Current Behavior:**
- Stores health check results in database
- Tracks failures, response times, etc.

**Philosophy Check:**
- ⚠️ Stores data about source feeds
- ✅ But this is app-specific metadata
- ✅ Not trying to replace source feed data
- ✅ Used for monitoring/alerting only

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **Keep as-is** - This is app metadata, not podcast content.

---

### **3. Episode Count Cache** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE

**Current Behavior:**
- Caches episode count from source feeds
- Updated by cron every 30 minutes

**Philosophy Check:**
- ⚠️ Stores data from source feeds
- ✅ But clearly marked as cache
- ✅ Regularly updated from source
- ✅ Not used as source of truth

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **Keep as-is** - Cache is acceptable for performance.

---

## 🚫 What Would Break The Philosophy

### **Things NOT To Do:**

❌ **Store Individual Episodes**
```php
// DON'T DO THIS
<podcast>
    <episodes>
        <episode>
            <title>Episode 1</title>
            <audio_url>...</audio_url>
            <duration>...</duration>
        </episode>
    </episodes>
</podcast>
```
**Why:** You'd be hosting episode data, not aggregating feeds.

---

❌ **Host Audio Files**
```php
// DON'T DO THIS
$audioFile = download_audio($episode['audio_url']);
save_locally($audioFile);
```
**Why:** You'd become a podcast host, not an aggregator.

---

❌ **Serve Episodes in Your Feed**
```xml
<!-- DON'T DO THIS -->
<item>
    <title>Episode 1</title>
    <enclosure url="https://yoursite.com/audio/ep1.mp3"/>
</item>
```
**Why:** Your feed should point to source feeds, not serve episodes.

---

❌ **Store Episode Descriptions**
```php
// DON'T DO THIS
foreach ($episodes as $episode) {
    save_to_database([
        'episode_title' => $episode['title'],
        'episode_description' => $episode['description'],
        'episode_date' => $episode['pubDate']
    ]);
}
```
**Why:** Episode-level data should come from source feeds.

---

## ✅ What's Acceptable To Store

### **Metadata (App-Specific):**
- ✅ Podcast title, description
- ✅ Source feed URL
- ✅ Cover image (cached)
- ✅ Created date, updated date
- ✅ Active/inactive status
- ✅ Health check results
- ✅ User notes/tags (if added)

### **Cache (Performance):**
- ✅ Latest episode date
- ✅ Episode count
- ✅ Feed type (RSS 2.0, Atom)
- ✅ Response time metrics

### **Pointers (Aggregation):**
- ✅ Source feed URLs
- ✅ Source image URLs
- ✅ Source website URLs

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **Keep Doing:**
1. ✅ Point to source feeds in output
2. ✅ Cache episode data for performance
3. ✅ Update cache regularly via cron
4. ✅ Fetch live data when accuracy matters
5. ✅ Store metadata, not content

### **Don't Do:**
1. ❌ Store individual episodes
2. ❌ Host audio files
3. ❌ Serve episodes in your feed
4. ❌ Try to replace source feeds
5. ❌ Store episode-level data permanently

### **Consider For Future:**
1. 💡 Add "Last Synced" timestamp to UI
2. 💡 Show cache age in table
3. 💡 Add "Refresh All" button
4. 💡 Add cache expiration warnings
5. 💡 Document cache strategy in UI

## 🔮 Future Evolution Paths

### **If You Want To Become A Podcast Host:**
You'd need to:
- Store individual episodes
- Host audio files
- Serve episodes in your feed
- Handle episode-level CRUD
- Manage audio storage/bandwidth

**But that's a MAJOR architecture change!**

### **If You Want To Stay An Aggregator:**
You can add:
- ✅ More metadata fields
- ✅ Better caching strategies
- ✅ Advanced health monitoring
- ✅ Feed analytics
- ✅ User preferences
- ✅ Feed discovery
- ✅ Podcast recommendations

**All without changing core philosophy!**

---

## 📝 Documentation Needs

### **Already Documented:**
- ✅ README.md has architecture section

- ✅ Code comments explain philosophy

### **Should Add:**
- 💡 Architecture diagram in README
- 💡 "What We Store vs What We Fetch" table
- 💡 Cache strategy documentation
- 💡 When to use cache vs live fetch

---
