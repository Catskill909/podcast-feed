# Podcast Player Modal - UI Refinements

## Changes Made (Oct 16, 2025)

### ✅ Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Removed Hover Animation**
- **Before**: Episode cards would slide and elevate on hover
- **After**: Only subtle border color change on hover
- **Why**: Cleaner, less distracting UI

**CSS Changes:**
```css
/* Removed transform and box-shadow from hover */
.player-episode-card:hover {
  border-color: var(--border-focus); /* Only border changes now */
}
```

#### 2. **Removed Share Button from Episodes**
- **Before**: Each episode had Download, Share, and Play buttons
- **After**: Only Download and Play buttons remain
- **Why**: Sharing individual episodes isn't practical in a web app context

**What Was Removed:**
- Share button from episode cards
- `shareEpisode()` function from JavaScript
- Share icon and click handler

#### 3. **Added Spacing Between Action Buttons**
- **Before**: Buttons were too close together (`gap: var(--spacing-xs)`)
- **After**: More breathing room (`gap: var(--spacing-sm)`)
- **Why**: Better touch targets and visual clarity

**CSS Changes:**
```css
.player-episode-actions {
  gap: var(--spacing-sm); /* Increased from xs to sm */
}
```

#### 4. **Improved "Share Feed" Functionality**
- **Before**: Generic "Podcast feed URL copied" message
- **After**: "RSS feed URL copied! You can paste this into any podcast app."
- **Why**: More descriptive and helpful for users

**Features:**
- Better clipboard fallback for older browsers
- More informative success message
- Explains what to do with the copied URL

#### 5. **Fixed CSS Compatibility Warnings**
- Added standard `line-clamp` property alongside `-webkit-line-clamp`
- Added standard `appearance` property alongside `-webkit-appearance`
- **Why**: Better cross-browser compatibility
