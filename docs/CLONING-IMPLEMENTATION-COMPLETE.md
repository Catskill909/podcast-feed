## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Ensure PHP `max_execution_time` allows long processes (or set in code)
- [ ] Check available disk space
- [ ] Verify `uploads/audio/` directory exists and is writable

### Test Cases:

#### 1. Small Feed (5 episodes)
- [ ] Enter feed URL
- [ ] Validate feed
- [ ] Review preview
- [ ] Start cloning
- [ ] Watch progress
- [ ] Verify completion
- [ ] Check files in `uploads/audio/`
- [ ] Test RSS feed generation
- [ ] Test delete cleanup

#### 2. Medium Feed (20-50 episodes)
- [ ] Clone with episode images
- [ ] Clone without episode images
- [ ] Test episode limit option
- [ ] Test import to directory option

#### 3. Error Scenarios:
- [ ] Invalid feed URL
- [ ] Feed with some 404 audio files
- [ ] Feed with oversized files (>500MB)
- [ ] Network timeout simulation

#### 4. Delete Cleanup:
- [ ] Clone a podcast
- [ ] Delete the podcast
- [ ] Verify NO orphaned files in `uploads/audio/`
- [ ] Verify NO orphaned files in `uploads/covers/`
- [ ] Verify NO empty directories

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Test with small feed** (5 episodes)
2. **Verify progress tracking** works
3. **Test delete cleanup** removes all files
4. **Check error handling** with bad feeds

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Resume interrupted clones
- [ ] Parallel episode downloads (3 at once)
- [ ] Incremental sync (update existing clones)
- [ ] Cloud storage option (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces)
- [ ] Selective episode cloning (choose which episodes)
- [ ] Schedule cloning for off-peak hours

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Long-Running Process**
   - Cloning 150 episodes may take 15-30 minutes
   - Requires PHP `max_execution_time` to be high enough
   - Solution: Set `set_time_limit(3600)` in code (already done)

2. **No Resume Capability (Yet)**
   - If interrupted, must start over
   - Future enhancement planned

3. **Sequential Downloads**
   - Episodes downloaded one at a time
   - Future: Parallel downloads for speed

4. **Storage Space**
   - No automatic cleanup of old clones
   - User must manually delete unwanted podcasts
