## 🚀 How It Works

### Local Development (Your MacBook)

1. **Create Podcast**
   - Go to admin → "Create Self-Hosted Podcast"
   - Fill in metadata, upload cover
   - Save

2. **Add Episode with Audio**
   - Click "Episodes" → "Add New Episode"
   - Fill in title and description
   - **Upload MP3 file** (drag & drop or click)
   - System auto-detects duration and file size
   - Save

3. **Audio Stored Locally**
   - File saved to: `/uploads/audio/{podcast_id}/{episode_id}.mp3`
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/uploads/audio/shp_123/ep_456.mp3`

4. **RSS Feed Generated**
   - `/self-hosted-feed.php?id=shp_123`
   - Points to YOUR hosted audio files
   - Fully iTunes compliant

### Production (Coolify)

**Same workflow, but:**
- Files stored in **persistent volume** `/uploads/audio/`
- URLs use your production domain: `https://yourdomain.com/uploads/audio/...`
- Survives deployments (persistent storage)
- No configuration changes needed!

## 🧪 Testing Locally

### Test Audio Upload

1. **Start local server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/paulhenshaw/Desktop/podcast-feed
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Create test podcast:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/self-hosted-podcasts.php`
   - Click "Create New Podcast"
   - Fill in basic info
   - Upload a cover image
   - Save

3. **Add episode with audio:**
   - Click "Episodes" button
   - Click "Add New Episode"
   - Fill in title: "Test Episode 1"
   - **Upload an MP3 file** (any MP3 will work)
   - Watch the preview appear
   - Save

4. **Verify storage:**
   ```bash
   ls -la uploads/audio/
   # Should see podcast folder
   
   ls -la uploads/audio/shp_*/
   # Should see .mp3 file
   ```

5. **Test RSS feed:**
   - Copy the RSS feed URL from podcast card
   - Open in browser
   - Verify `<enclosure url="http://localhost:8000/uploads/audio/...mp3">`

6. **Test playback:**
   - Click "Play" button on episode
   - Should stream from your local server

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### PHP Settings (for large files)

**Local (php.ini or .htaccess):**
```ini
upload_max_filesize = 500M
post_max_size = 500M
max_execution_time = 600
memory_limit = 256M
```

**Check current limits:**
```bash
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize
php -i | grep post_max_size
```

### Coolify Settings

When deploying, Coolify should handle this automatically, but verify:
- Persistent volume mounted at `/uploads`
- PHP upload limits configured
- Nginx/Apache client_max_body_size = 500M

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### File Validation
- ✅ MP3 MIME type checking
- ✅ File extension validation (.mp3 only)
- ✅ Magic number verification (checks file header)
- ✅ Size limits enforced (500MB max)
- ✅ Sanitized filenames

### Access Control
- ✅ Admin password required for uploads
- ✅ Public read access to audio files (for streaming)
- ✅ No directory listing (via .htaccess)
- ✅ PHP execution prevented in audio directory

### .htaccess Protection
```apache
# Allow MP3 downloads
<FilesMatch "\.mp3$">
    Header set Content-Type "audio/mpeg"
    Header set Accept-Ranges "bytes"
</FilesMatch>

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes

# Prevent PHP execution
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```

---

## 📊 Storage Considerations

### Typical File Sizes
- **30-minute episode:** ~20-30 MB (128 kbps)
- **60-minute episode:** ~40-60 MB (128 kbps)
- **Cover image:** 0.5-2 MB

### Planning
- **10 podcasts × 50 episodes × 30 MB** = ~15 GB
- **100 podcasts × 20 episodes × 30 MB** = ~60 GB

Monitor your server storage and plan accordingly.

## 🎯 Workflow Example

### Creating a Complete Hosted Podcast

**Step 1: Create Podcast**
```
Title: "Tech Talk Weekly"
Author: "John Doe"
Email: "john@example.com"
Category: Technology
Cover: [Upload 3000x3000 image]
```

**Step 2: Add Episode 1**
```
Title: "Introduction to AI"
Description: "We discuss the basics of AI..."
Audio: [Upload episode-001.mp3 - 45 minutes, 42 MB]
Episode #: 1
Status: Published
```

**Step 3: System Actions**
- Uploads MP3 to `/uploads/audio/shp_1729123456/ep_1729123457.mp3`
- Extracts duration: 2700 seconds (00:45:00)
- Records file size: 44040192 bytes
- Saves metadata to XML

**Step 4: RSS Feed**
```xml
<enclosure url="https://yourdomain.com/uploads/audio/shp_1729123456/ep_1729123457.mp3" 
           length="44040192" 
           type="audio/mpeg"/>
<itunes:duration>00:45:00</itunes:duration>
```

**Step 5: Import to Directory** (Optional)
- Copy feed URL
- Use "Import from RSS" in main admin
- Self-hosted podcast appears alongside external ones

**Step 6: Publish**
- Submit RSS feed to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.
- Audio streams directly from your server
- Full control over your content!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

**Problem:** "File size exceeds maximum"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check PHP limits
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize

# Increase in php.ini or .htaccess
upload_max_filesize = 500M
post_max_size = 500M
```

### File Not Found

**Problem:** Audio URL returns 404

**Solution:**
- Check file exists: `ls uploads/audio/shp_*/`
- Verify permissions: `chmod 755 uploads/audio`
- Check .htaccess allows MP3 access

### Duration Not Detected

**Problem:** Duration shows 00:00:00

**Solution:**
- This is normal - basic MP3 parsing is approximate
- You can manually enter duration in HH:MM:SS format
- For production, consider adding getID3 library for accurate parsing
