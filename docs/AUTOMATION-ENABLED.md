# ✅ Automation Enabled!

## 🎉 Done! Your Podcast Feed is Now Self-Updating

I've set up the automated scanning for you. Here's what's running:

---

## ⚙️ What I Did

### 1. **Installed Cron Job**
```bash
*/30 * * * * cd /Users/paulhenshaw/Desktop/podcast-feed && php cron/auto-scan-feeds.php >> logs/auto-scan.log 2>&1
```

**Translation**: Every 30 minutes, your system automatically:
- Scans all podcast RSS feeds
- Detects new episodes
- Updates episode dates in database
- Logs the results

### 2. **Added Status Indicator**
Your admin panel now shows:
- 🔄 Auto-scan status
- Last scan time
- Tooltip explaining it runs every 30 minutes

---

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Current Time: 2:00 PM
  ↓
2:00 PM - Cron runs scanner
  ↓
Scanner checks all podcast feeds
  ↓
Finds new episode on "Tech Talk" (published 1:45 PM)
  ↓
Updates database with new episode date
  ↓
2:01 PM - User opens podcast app
  ↓
App fetches: feed.php?sort=episodes&order=desc
  ↓
"Tech Talk" appears at top (newest episode!)
  ↓
Next scan: 2:30 PM
```

**No manual refresh needed - it just works!** 🚀

```

**Features:**

## 🔧 Future: Settings Menu

In the future, you can add a settings page to:
- Change scan interval (15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, etc.)
- Enable/disable auto-scan
- View scan history
- Configure notifications
- Set per-podcast scan rules

**For now**: It's set to 30 minutes (perfect for most use cases!)

## ✅ Verification

### Test It's Working:

1. **Check cron is installed:**
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   # Should show: */30 * * * * cd /Users/paulhenshaw/Desktop/podcast-feed...
   ```

2. **View admin panel:**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000
   - Look for "Auto-scan: X mins ago" next to sort button
   - Hover over ℹ️ icon for tooltip

3. **Wait for next scan:**
   - Scans run at :00 and :30 of each hour
   - Check logs: `tail -f logs/auto-scan.log`
   - Watch for updates in admin panel

4. **Verify feed updates:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000/feed.php
