# Production Fix - "Loading..." Issue

## Problem

Production server showed "Loading..." for all Latest Episode dates, while local worked fine.

**Root Cause:** JavaScript wasn't executing or was executing before DOM was ready.

---

## Solution: Progressive Enhancement

### What I Changed

#### 1. Added Server-Side Fallback (index.php lines 331-345)

**Before:**
```php
<td class="text-muted latest-episode-cell">
    <span>Loading...</span>
</td>
```

**After:**
```php
<td class="text-muted latest-episode-cell">
    <?php 
    if (!empty($podcast['latest_episode_date'])) {
        $epDate = new DateTime($podcast['latest_episode_date']);
        echo '<span class="server-date">' . $epDate->format('M j, Y') . '</span>';
    } else {
        echo '<span>Unknown</span>';
    }
    ?>
</td>
```

#### 2. Enhanced JavaScript Reliability (app.js lines 1712-1753)

- Added console logging for debugging
- Made function globally available (`window.updateAllLatestEpisodeDates`)
- Multiple execution methods:
  - DOMContentLoaded event
  - Immediate execution if DOM already loaded
  - setTimeout fallback after 100ms

---

## How It Works Now

### Without JavaScript (Fallback)
- Server renders: "Oct 16, 2025" (absolute date)
- User sees a date immediately
- Works even if JavaScript fails to load

### With JavaScript (Enhanced)
- JavaScript runs and replaces with: "Yesterday" (relative date)
- Better user experience
- Same calculation as modals

---

## Why This Is Better

✅ **Always shows something** - Never shows "Loading..." indefinitely  
✅ **Works without JavaScript** - Progressive enhancement  
✅ **Works with JavaScript** - Enhanced to show relative dates  
✅ **Production-safe** - Handles timing issues and script loading failures  
✅ **Same as modals** - Reads from `row.dataset.latestEpisode`  

---

## Testing

### On Production
1. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Should immediately show dates like "Oct 16, 2025"
3. After JavaScript loads, should update to "Yesterday"
4. Open console - should see logs like:
   ```
   Updating 6 date cells
   Processing date: 2025-10-16 14:00:00
   Date update complete
   ```

### If Still Broken
Check console for errors. The function is now globally available, so you can manually run:
```javascript
window.updateAllLatestEpisodeDates()
```

## Files Changed

1. **index.php** - Added server-side date rendering
2. **assets/js/app.js** - Enhanced JavaScript with fallbacks and logging

---

## Status

✅ Local: Works  
✅ Production: Should work now (with fallback)  
✅ Modals: Still work (unchanged)  
✅ Progressive enhancement: Implemented  

Deploy and test!
