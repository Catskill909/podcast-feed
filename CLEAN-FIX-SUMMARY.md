# Clean Mobile Fix - Final Implementation

## What Was Wrong
- Had mobile CSS in TWO places (browse.css AND inline in index.php) - confusing and redundant
- Used `@media (max-width: 480px)` which is TOO NARROW - many phones report 600-800px width
- Used `@media (pointer: coarse)` which is NOT universally supported

## What I Fixed

### 1. Removed ALL Inline CSS from index.php
- Deleted lines 37-99 (the entire `<style>` block)
- Now CSS is ONLY in browse.css where it belongs

### 2. Fixed browse.css with Proper Breakpoints

**For ALL Mobile/Tablet (≤768px):**
- Disables hover effects
- Hides play overlay completely
- Prevents text selection and blue highlights  
- Makes badges LARGE (18px font, 12px/18px padding, 40px min-height)

**For Phones Only (≤480px):**
- Scales cards to 88%
- Adds grid padding
- Sticky search bar
- Single column layout

## Files Changed
1. `/index.php` - Removed inline CSS (cleaner)
2. `/assets/css/browse.css` - Fixed with proper breakpoints

## Why This Will Work
- `768px` breakpoint catches ALL mobile devices
- No conflicting CSS in multiple places
- Proper CSS cascade - one source of truth
- Uses universally-supported media queries

## Test It
Just refresh your phone browser - browse.css has cache busting with `?v=<?php echo time(); ?>`
