# Latest Episode Display Fix - March 10, 2024

## Overview
Fixed the "Latest Episode" display to show real-time data from podcast RSS feeds instead of relying on stored database values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Real-time RSS Feed Fetching
- Modified `PodcastManager.php` to fetch latest episode data directly from RSS feeds
- Added proper error handling to prevent feed fetch failures from breaking the UI
- Implemented fallback to stored values when feed fetch fails

### 2. RSS Import Improvements
- Fixed form submission in `app.js` to properly handle file uploads and metadata
- Added proper error handling and user feedback during import
- Ensured latest episode date and episode count are correctly passed during import

### 3. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Implemented graceful degradation when feeds are unavailable
- Added user-friendly error messages

## Testing
- [x] Verified latest episode dates update in real-time
- [x] Confirmed RSS import works with all required fields
- [x] Tested error handling for invalid/missing feeds
- [x] Verified proper fallback to stored values when feed fetch fails

## Notes
- The system now provides more accurate and up-to-date episode information
- Failed feed fetches are logged but don't prevent the rest of the application from functioning
- The RSS import process is now more robust and provides better feedback
