# FINAL DIAGNOSIS - THE REAL PROBLEM

## Current State
The app ALREADY HAS mobile CSS in TWO places:
1. `browse.css` lines 595-676 - Mobile styles with `!important`
2. `index.php` lines 37-99 - Inline mobile styles with `!important`

Both have:
- Badge sizing (15px, 8px 14px padding)
- Card scaling (0.88)
- Text selection disabled
- Play overlay hidden

## Why It's Not Working

**The media query `@media (max-width: 480px)` is NOT matching on your phones.**

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Viewport is being reported as LARGER than 480px**
   - High-DPI phones report logical pixels, not physical pixels
   - iPhone 14 Pro reports 393px width (should match)
   - But some phones report 600-800px logical width

2. **Viewport meta tag might be ignored or overridden**
   - Current: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
   - Some browsers ignore this

3. **CSS is loading but being overridden by something AFTER**
   - Could be browser extensions
   - Could be hosting platform injecting CSS
   - Could be service worker

## THE REAL FIX

Stop using `max-width: 480px`. Use `max-width: 768px` for ALL mobile styles since that catches tablets AND phones.

The current code uses:
- `@media (pointer: coarse)` - NOT universally supported
- `@media (max-width: 480px)` - TOO narrow, misses many phones

Should use:
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` - Catches all mobile devices
- Apply ALL fixes at this breakpoint

## Clean Solution

Remove ALL inline CSS from index.php and fix ONLY browse.css with proper breakpoint.
