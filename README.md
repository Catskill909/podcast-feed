  - Cron-based auto-scan runs every 15 minutes in production (`cron/auto-scan-feeds.php` via Coolify scheduled task)
  - New `FeedScanner` class (`includes/FeedScanner.php`) performs lazy scans from `feed.php` and `api/get-public-podcasts.php` when data is older than 5 minutes
  - Existing browser-based auto-refresh remains as an extra safety net on `index.php` and `admin.php`
- ✅ **Fresh Data For All Consumers**: Browse page, embed feed, and admin all read from an up-to-date `data/podcasts.xml`
  - Public browse page now reliably shows correct "Latest: X days ago" badges for new visitors
  - `feed.php` outputs fresh `latestEpisodeDate` values for external apps and embeds
  - Manual refresh button (🔄) still bypasses cache for instant per-podcast updates
- ✅ **Safe Caching & Permissions**: RSS caching moved into the app's writable data directory
  - `RssFeedParser` now stores cache files in `data/cache/` instead of `/tmp` to avoid container permission issues
  - Background activity is visible via `logs/auto-scan.log` (cron) and `logs/lazy-scan.log` (lazy scans)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINE - READ FIRST

**These principles MUST be followed on every task. They prevent hours of wasted effort:**

### **🔍 Before Making ANY Changes:**

1. **READ ALL PROVIDED DOCUMENTATION FIRST**
   - Review debug docs, error logs, and user-provided context completely
   - Understand what has already been tried and failed
   - Never skip documentation - it contains the full picture

2. **TRACE THE COMPLETE CODE PATH**
   - Follow the entire flow from user action to server response
   - Read the actual code files - don't assume how things work
   - Check element IDs, form submissions, JavaScript callbacks, server handlers
   - Verify data flow: form → JavaScript → AJAX → server → database

3. **LOOK FOR SIMPLE BUGS FIRST**
   - Element ID mismatches (JavaScript looking for wrong IDs)
   - Form inputs trying to upload files twice
   - Validation blocking legitimate submissions
   - Missing or incorrect field names
   - Callback functions called at wrong times

4. **REASON THROUGH EXPECTED vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR**
   - What SHOULD happen when the user clicks "Submit"?
   - What IS actually happening? (Check logs, network tab, console)
   - Where does the actual behavior diverge from expected?
   - Is it a code bug or infrastructure issue?

5. **ONLY FIX INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER CODE IS PROVEN CORRECT**
   - Don't create Dockerfiles, modify nginx configs, or change servers
   - Infrastructure changes should be LAST RESORT
   - 95% of bugs are code logic, not server config

### **🚫 NEVER DO THESE:**

- ❌ Stab in the dark with infrastructure changes
- ❌ Create Dockerfiles without verifying code correctness first
- ❌ Modify `.htaccess` when using Nginx (or vice versa)
- ❌ Ask user to "test and see what happens" without analyzing code
- ❌ Make assumptions about element IDs or form behavior
- ❌ Skip reading provided debug documentation
- ❌ Add complexity before finding the simple bug

### **✅ ALWAYS DO THESE:**

- ✅ Read all provided docs and error logs completely
- ✅ Trace code path from start to finish
- ✅ Look for simple bugs (IDs, validation, callbacks)
- ✅ Verify form submission flow in detail
- ✅ Check for double file uploads or duplicate processes
- ✅ Test logic mentally before making changes
- ✅ Add targeted debug logging to confirm hypothesis

### **📝 Real Example - What Went Wrong (Oct 18, 2025):**

**Problem:** Large file upload works via AJAX but form submission freezes

**What I Did Wrong:**
1. Created Apache Dockerfile (user had Nginx)
2. Tried to add Traefik labels (UI doesn't exist)
3. Modified `.htaccess` for Apache (running Nginx)
4. Created `nixpacks.toml` without checking code
5. Hours of infrastructure changes with no progress

**What I Should Have Done:**
1. Read the code in `self-hosted-episodes.php`
2. Trace: Form submission → Audio file input → AJAX upload → Form POST
3. Found Bug #1: Element ID mismatch (`'audio_url'` vs `'audioUrlInput'`)
4. Found Bug #2: Image validation too strict for episodes
5. Found Bug #3: Form trying to upload 251MB file AGAIN after AJAX already uploaded it
6. **Total fix time: 15 minutes of code analysis**

**The Simple Truth:**
- AJAX uploaded the file successfully ✅
- Form still had the 251MB file attached ❌
- Form tried to upload it again → timeout
- **Solution:** Clear and disable the file input after AJAX completes

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: What This App Does

**PodFeed Builder is BOTH a feed aggregator AND a complete podcast hosting platform.**

### **Dual Purpose:**
1. **Feed Aggregator** - Creates a meta-feed (RSS feed of RSS feeds) for consumption by external applications (Flutter app, podcast players, etc.). Aggregates multiple podcast feeds into a single manageable directory.
2. **Podcast Hosting Platform** - Full podcast creation system where you can create podcasts from scratch, upload audio files, manage episodes, and generate iTunes-compliant RSS feeds.

### **Critical Architecture Principle:**

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **What This Means For Development:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Latest episode dates and episode counts should ALWAYS come from the source RSS feeds, never from your database during import.

**Why?**
- You don't host the podcasts - you just list them
- Source feeds are the single source of truth
- Your database is just a cache for performance
- Episode data must stay current with source feeds

**How It Works:**
1. **Import:** Saves podcast metadata (title, URL, image) - NO episode data
2. **Cron Job:** Fetches episode data from source feeds every 30 minutes
3. **Display:** Shows cached episode data from database (fast)
4. **Modal/Preview:** Fetches live from source feeds (always current)
5. **Your Feed:** Points to source feeds (Flutter app fetches from source)

**Don't Try To:**
- ❌ Store episode dates during import (they'll be stale)
- ❌ Fetch RSS feeds on every page load (too slow)
- ❌ Treat your database as the source of truth for episodes

**Do:**
- ✅ Let cron job update episode data regularly
- ✅ Cache episode data for display performance
- ✅ Fetch live data only when needed (modals, health checks)
- ✅ Always point to source feeds in your output

### **Current Capabilities:**
✅ **Feed Aggregator** - Import and manage external podcast RSS feeds
✅ **Podcast Hosting Platform ("My Podcasts")** - Create and host your own podcasts with audio uploads
✅ **Podcast Player Website** - Public browsing interface with in-browser player
✅ **Episode Management System** - Full CRUD operations for episodes

**Future Potential:**
- Analytics dashboard
- Automated transcription
- Multi-user podcast networks
- Monetization features

## 📡 RSS Feed URLs

### For Podcast Apps

Your RSS feed uses **server-side sort preferences** for consistent output:

```
# Default (uses saved preference from admin panel)
https://your-domain.com/feed.php

# Override with explicit sort parameters
https://your-domain.com/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=desc  # Newest episodes
https://your-domain.com/feed.php?sort=episodes&order=asc   # Oldest episodes
https://your-domain.com/feed.php?sort=title&order=asc      # Alphabetical A-Z
https://your-domain.com/feed.php?sort=date&order=desc      # Newest added
https://your-domain.com/feed.php?sort=status&order=desc    # Active first
```

**How It Works:**
- Admin changes sort in any browser → Saves to server
- `feed.php` reads saved preference as default
- External apps get consistently sorted feed
- URL parameters can override saved preference

### Sort Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `sort` | `episodes`, `date`, `title`, `status` | What to sort by |
| `order` | `asc`, `desc` | Ascending or descending |

**Default**: Uses saved preference from admin panel (changeable anytime)

### Automated Updates

- **Episode Data**: Feed automatically updates every 30 minutes via cron job
- **Sort Preferences**: Sync across all browsers automatically (30-second polling)
- **Latest Episode Dates**: Fetched from source RSS feeds automatically
- **No Manual Refresh**: Changes appear automatically in all browsers
- **Always Fresh**: Content and sorting stay current
