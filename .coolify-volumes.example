# Coolify Persistent Volumes Configuration
# Copy this configuration to your Coolify dashboard

# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Go to Coolify Dashboard
# 2. Select your podcast-feed application
# 3. Navigate to "Storage" or "Persistent Storage" tab
# 4. Add these three volumes:

# ============================================
# VOLUME 1: Data Directory (XML Database)
# ============================================
Name: podcast-data
Source: (leave empty for Docker managed volume)
Destination: /app/data
Description: XML database and backups

# ============================================
# VOLUME 2: Uploads Directory (Cover Images)
# ============================================
Name: podcast-uploads
Source: (leave empty for Docker managed volume)
Destination: /app/uploads
Description: Podcast cover images

# ============================================
# VOLUME 3: Logs Directory (Application Logs)
# ============================================
Name: podcast-logs
Source: (leave empty for Docker managed volume)
Destination: /app/logs
Description: Error and operation logs

# ============================================
# ONE-TIME PERMISSION FIX (After adding volumes)
# ============================================
# Run this ONCE in Coolify terminal after adding volumes:
#
# cd /app
# chown -R 65534:65534 data uploads logs
# chmod -R 755 data uploads logs
#
# Then redeploy. Permissions will persist across all future deployments!

# ============================================
# VERIFICATION
# ============================================
# After setup, visit: https://your-domain.com/check-user.php
# All directories should show "âœ… Writable"
# Deploy again - should still work without manual commands!
