# ⚡ Quick Start: Fix Deployment Issues NOW

**Time to fix:** 10-15 minutes  
**Benefit:** Never run manual commands after deployment again!

---

## 🎯 The Problem

After every Coolify deployment, you have to manually run:
```bash
cd /app
chown -R 65534:65534 data uploads logs
chmod -R 755 data uploads logs
```

**This ends today!**

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Persistent Volumes (BEST - Permanent Fix)

### Step 1: Add Volumes in Coolify (5 minutes)

1. **Open Coolify Dashboard** → Your podcast-feed app
2. **Go to "Storage" or "Persistent Storage" tab**
3. **Add these 3 volumes:**

   ```
   Volume 1:
   Name: podcast-data
   Destination: /app/data
   
   Volume 2:
   Name: podcast-uploads
   Destination: /app/uploads
   
   Volume 3:
   Name: podcast-logs
   Destination: /app/logs
   ```

### Step 2: Fix Permissions ONE TIME (1 minute)

Open Coolify terminal and run:
```bash
cd /app
chown -R 65534:65534 data uploads logs
chmod -R 755 data uploads logs
```

### Step 3: Redeploy & Verify (2 minutes)

1. Click "Redeploy" in Coolify
2. Visit `https://your-domain.com/check-user.php`
3. Should show all directories writable ✅
4. Test delete operation - should work!

### Step 4: Test Persistence (2 minutes)

1. Make a small code change
2. Push to GitHub (Coolify auto-deploys)
3. **DON'T run any commands**
4. Test delete again - **should still work!** 🎉

**Done! You'll never need to run those commands again!**

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Automated Script (BACKUP - If volumes don't work)

### Option A: Post-Deploy Hook

In Coolify Dashboard:
1. Go to your app → **Settings**
2. Find **"Post-Deploy Script"** or **"Lifecycle Hooks"**
3. Add this script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /app
chown -R 65534:65534 data uploads logs
chmod -R 755 data uploads logs
echo "✅ Permissions fixed automatically!"
```

4. Save and redeploy

### Option B: Use Nixpacks Start Script

In Coolify Dashboard:
1. Go to your app → **Settings**
2. Find **"Start Command"** or **"Custom Start Command"**
3. Set to: `bash nixpacks-start.sh`
4. Save and redeploy

**Note:** The `nixpacks-start.sh` file is already in your repo with the correct settings!

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### After Setup:

1. ✅ Visit `/check-user.php` - all directories writable
2. ✅ Delete a podcast - works
3. ✅ Add a podcast - works
4. ✅ Upload image - works
5. ✅ Import RSS - works

### After Next Deployment:

1. ✅ Push code change to GitHub
2. ✅ Coolify deploys automatically
3. ✅ **DON'T run any commands**
4. ✅ Test operations - **everything still works!**

## 🆘 Emergency: Production is Broken Right Now

**Quick fix (2 minutes):**

```bash
# In Coolify terminal:
cd /app
chown -R 65534:65534 data uploads logs
chmod -R 755 data uploads logs
```

**Then implement one of the permanent solutions above!**

## 📊 Which Solution Should I Use?

| Solution | Difficulty | Permanence | Recommended |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Persistent Volumes** | Easy | ✅ Permanent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ YES! |
| **Post-Deploy Hook** | Easy | ✅ Permanent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good |
| **Start Script** | Easy | ✅ Permanent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good |
| **Manual Commands** | Easy | ❌ Temporary | ❌ NO! |

**Recommendation:** Try Persistent Volumes first. If that doesn't work, use Post-Deploy Hook.

## 🎓 Why This Happens

**Your app uses file-based storage:**
- XML database: `data/podcasts.xml`
- Cover images: `uploads/covers/`
- Logs: `logs/`

**The problem:**
- Local: You own files → works ✅
- Production: Root owns files, PHP runs as `nobody` → breaks ❌

**The fix:**
- Make `nobody` (UID 65534) own the files
- Use persistent volumes so ownership survives deployments

- `PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-FINAL.md` - Permission details
- `.coolify-volumes.example` - Volume configuration template

**Still stuck?**
1. Check Coolify logs for errors
2. Verify PHP user: `php -r "echo exec('whoami');"`
3. Check file ownership: `ls -la /app/data`
4. Visit `/check-user.php` for diagnostics
